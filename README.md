RPi_Cam_Browser_Control
=======================

Raspberry Pi Camera control, feed and motion capture

This code is taken from Silvan Melchior and modified to sit around a git repository rather than downloads of tarballs.

I believe this is a better way of hosting the project and also am going to look to build in an update mechanism.
